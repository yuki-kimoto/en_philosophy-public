<p>
  in English
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  There's More Than One Way To Do It.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  It may be abbreviated as "TMTOWTDI".
</p>
<h2> Perl is a language that is tolerant of diversity </h2>
<p>
  Perl's "more than one way" slogan is an antithesis of the "one good way" idea.
</p>
<p>
  When you have multiple people and you have a team of multiple people and you are looking for a good way, there are multiple good ways.
</p>
<p>
  There are multiple good ways, not just one good way.
</p>
<p>
  <b> Let's admit both to multiple good practices. Recognize the variety of good practices. </b>
</p>
<p>
  That's the way of thinking.
</p>
<p>
  Perl is a language that is tolerant of diversity in itself.
</p>
<h2> Is diversity a value to be respected? </H2>
<p>
  Is diversity a value to be respected?
</p>
<p>
  In a project, it would be better to set uniformity, manage people, and thoroughly improve production efficiency for the purpose of the goal.
</p>
<p>
  There is such a way of thinking on the one hand.
</p>
<p>
  But on the other hand, this idea is also the one that has created inequality, discrimination and class.
</p>
<p>
  One worst example is the slave trade, where one race owns one race like a thing.
</p>
<p>
  One race monopolizes wealth and power and treats the other race as slaves.
</p>
<p>
  The sold slaves are packed in ships and moved from their own country to another country as industry leaders.
</p>
<p>
  Was humanity stupid from the beginning?
</p>
<p>
  No, it's not. Rather than having people plan to create discrimination from the beginning, many people start with the wrong decisions, and beyond a certain stage, they can't go back.
</p>
<p>
  Even if there are many people who look back on history and can say that it was a mistake, ethics will not work while being swallowed by that era.
</p>
<p>
  Also, linguistic and biodiversity are rapidly being lost by the goodwill of mankind.
</p>
<p>
  <b> One defense is the idea of ​​finding value for diversity, itself. </b>
</p>
<p>
  Perl's "more than one way" slogan is a great slogan in that it finds value in diversity itself.
</p>
<h2> Perl's slogan "There is more than one way" has been misunderstood. </H2>
<p>
  Perl's slogan, "There's more than one way," is one of the most misunderstood Perl ideas.
</p>
<p>
  A good idea to respect Perl's diversity is
</p>
<p>
  "Writing in Perl results in different code for different people"
</p>
<p>
  "Not suitable for large-scale development"
</p>
<p>
  "Become a light-only language"
</p>
<p>
  "I can't read the code I wrote three days ago."
</p>
<p>
  Has been criticized.
</p>
<p>
  The prejudice against Perl is strong, but the facts are different.
</p>
<h3> You can read the code written a year ago </h3>
<p>
  In fact, you can read the Perl code I wrote a year ago.
</p>
<p>
  Even if you don't understand the source code of Perl at first, if you learn about Perl for about a month, you will understand how to edit the source code to some extent.
</p>
<p>
  Well-structured source code in a modern way is easy to read over the years.
</p>
<p>
  The readability of source code depends more on the writer than on the programming language.
</p>
<p>
  And this isn't limited to Perl.
</p>
<p>
  It's true that Perl relies on the writer's writing style for the slogan of respecting diversity, but it can have terrible consequences, such as being completely uncorrectable. ,There is none.
</p>
<p>
  <b> If you improve your ability, good refactoring will make the source code maintainable and readable. </b>
</p>
<h3> Large-scale development is possible </h3>
<p>
  The misunderstanding about Perl is that the source code becomes unreadable after 1000 lines.
</p>
<p>
  However, in a real Perl project, there are usually more than 100 modules.
</p>
<p>
  Some projects have more than 100,000 lines of source code.
</p>
<p>
  <b> Perl actually allows for large-scale development, so projects of this size exist. </b>
</p>
<p>
  Perl has the ability to define namespaces called packages, and as your project grows, you can even split the functionality into separate modules.
</p>
<p>
  Perl also has the language features that modern programming has to withstand the large-scale system development.
</p>
<p>
  I want to develop Web development that handles a large amount of text processing at low cost. Perl is perfect for these cases as well.
