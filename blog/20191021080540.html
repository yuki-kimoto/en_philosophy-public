<p>
  Perl is not a programming language that keeps up with the times, trends and popularity, and keeps up with new things.
</p>
<p>
  What can be solved with a classic and simple solution will be used, and if necessary in a new field, it will be incorporated over time.
</p>
<p>
  Perl focuses on text processing that is often used in daily work, and is characterized by being easy for users to use.
</p>
<p>
  The backward compatibility is very high, and the system can be operated stably.
</p>
<p>
  Below are some examples of how simple it works in Perl.
</p>
<h3> Reference counting GC </h3>
<p>
  Perl uses a classic and simple reference-counted GC.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://perlzemi.com/blog/20131010138141.html"> Characteristics of Perl's Garbage Collection (GC) --Reference Count GC</a>
</p>
<p>
  The strength of reference counting GC is that it is the simplest to implement in GC. It is an implementation that releases the object whose reference count is 0.
</p>
<p>
  In the internal implementation of a programming language, the implementation is consistent and rarely changes with Perl versions.
</p>
<p>
  What are the good points from the user's point of view? That is the ability to reduce latency.
</p>
<p>
  In the reference counting method GC, GC is performed every time an object is destroyed, so GC does not accumulate.
</p>
<p>
  Low latency is very important for non-blocking I / O, which is a web server implementation required for high performance.
</p>
<p>
  Perl optimizes performance for handling large amounts of text, which is also expected to result in the creation and destruction of large amounts of objects.
</p>
<p>
  The disadvantages of reference counting GC are, frankly, that the throughput is lower than that of generational GC, and in a program where objects are expected to exist for a long time, when a circular reference occurs, the weak reference function is used. It's something you have to use and manage yourself.
</p>
<p>
  In the post-Perl era, reference counting GC was once regarded as an old and bad implementation, but it is clear that low latency is important for performance in non-blocking I / O, which is a Web server implementation. Therefore, the reference count GC is being re-evaluated.
</p>
<h3> Single thread </h3>
<p>
  Perl programs are supposed to work on the assumption that they are single-threaded. Perl used to aim for threads, but now Perl's threading capabilities are deprecated.
</p>
<p>
  The reason is that even though the Perl core itself can support threads, third-party modules such as the CPAN module do not assume threads.
</p>
<p>
  That's why Perl sought to be a safe thread, but it was so heavy that it didn't reach the level required for a thread.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, Perl compiled on a Linux server, by default, chose to remove thread support and improve performance by about 10%.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, the existence of threads is a factor that reduces performance in itself.
</p>
<p>
  Perl chose to improve simplicity and performance, rather than choosing thread convenience and complexity. This is one of the personalities of the Perl language.
</p>
<p>
  In case of misunderstanding, I'll add it, but the lack of threads does not mean that the multiCPU cannot be fully used.
</p>
<p>
  Read this article about it.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/blog/20190918081634.html"> You can make the most of multiCPU even in Perl</a>
</p>
<h3> I've heard that Perl is complicated, but isn't it really? </H3>
<p>
  If you read this far, you may be wondering, "Perl is said to be complicated in the world, but isn't it?"
</p>
<p>
  It's half true, half wrong.
</p>
<p>
  One of the seemingly complex causes of Perl is not the language side, but the syntactic sugar.
</p>
<p>
  Sintuck sugar is a hassle to write many times, so let's prepare a notation that can be written easily. Also, since it is easy to make a mistake in the meaning, let's introduce an easy-to-understand notation.
</p>
<p>
  For example, in Perl, the following meanings are the same, but there are two expressions.
</p>
<pre>
my%person = ('name','yuki','age', 19);

my%person = (name =&gt;'yuki', age =&gt; 19);
</pre>
<p>
  Perl has a syntack sugar that looks the same when viewed from a computer, but looks different when viewed from a human.
</p>
<p>
  This gives the impression of being complicated on the surface.
</p>
<p>
  However, Syntack Sugar has been reviewed in recent years and is becoming more and more popular in languages ​​other than Perl.
</p>
<p>
  For example, the language kotlin is designed as a language that incorporates syntax sugar into the Java language while ensuring compatibility with Java.
</p>
<p>
  There are also many adoptions of Perl-like syntax sugar.
</p>
<p>
  However, it is also true that having multiple writing styles makes maintainability less if a good writing style is not chosen.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, before starting development, there is something called best practice from the accumulation of knowledge for a long time, so I think it is good to read it once.
