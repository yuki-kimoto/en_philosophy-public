<p>
  If you're learning C in the basics of software, it's relatively easy to distinguish between values ​​and references.
</p>
<p>
  The values ​​and pointers in C are the values ​​and references in Perl. References are also known as references.
</p>
<p>
  First of all, I will write what I want you to remember as a premise.
</p>
<h3> Dynamic arrays and associative arrays </h3>
<p>
  Perl has built-in dynamic arrays and associative arrays in the language. In the Perl language, dynamic arrays are simply called arrays, and associative arrays are called hashes.
</p>
<pre>
# Array (dynamic array)
my @nums = (1, 2, 3);

#Hash (associative array)
my%person = (age =&gt; 12, name =&gt;'kimoto');
</pre>
<p>
  <b> In Perl, keep in mind that variables to which arrays and hashes can be assigned are represented by the special symbols "@" and "%". </b>
</p>
<p>
  Remember that "@" is similar to the acronym a for Array. Remember that the "%" seems to correspond to a key and a value.
</p>
<p>
  Variables to which numbers or strings are assigned are represented by "$".
</p>
<pre>
# Numbers and strings
my $num = 4;
my $name ='kimoto';
</pre>
<h4> Variable correspondence </h4>
<p>
  I will briefly describe the correspondence of variables.
</p>
<table>
  <tr> <td> Numbers and strings </td> <td> $num, $name </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Array (dynamic array) </td> <td> @nums </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Hash (associative array) </td> <td>%person </td> </tr>
</table>
<h3> Perl's default assignment is a copy of the value </h3>
<p>
  Perl is based on the grammar of C language, and is considered to be easy for those who have learned C language to learn.
</p>
<p>
  The default behavior of assignments in C is copying values. Perl has the same specifications.
</p>
<h4> Copy of numbers </h4>
<p>
  Let's copy the numbers.
</p>
<pre>
my $num1 = 1;

# Copy of numbers
my $num2 = $num2;
</pre>
<p>
  The value 1 is copied. Are you surprised? You are not surprised. This is a familiar operation for those who know the language specifications of C language.
</p>
<h4> Copy of string </h4>
<p>
  Let's copy the string.
</p>
<pre>
my $name1 ='kimoto';

#Copy of string
my $name2 = $name1;
</pre>
<p>
  So what will happen? In fact, the string is copied. Even if you change $name1, the value of $name2 does not change.
</p>
<p>
  It is a Perl language specification that a copy is made when a <b> string is assigned. You can safely pass a string. </b>
</p>
<p>
  The internal implementation is copy-on-write. Performance is very good and there are no conflict issues on a single thread.
</p>
<h3> Copy of array </h3>
<p>
  Let's copy the array.
</p>
<pre>
my @nums1 = (1, 2, 3);

# Copy of array
my @nums2 = @nums1;
</pre>
<p>
  What will happen now? The array itself is copied. Even if you change the value of the element of @num1, the element of @nums2 does not change.
</p>
<p>
  It is a Perl language specification that a copy is made when an <b> array is assigned. </b>
</p>
<h3> Hash copy </h3>
<p>
  Let's copy the hash.
</p>
<pre>
my%person1 = (age =&gt; 12, name =&gt;'kimoto');

# Hash copy
my%person2 =%person1;
</pre>
<p>
  What will happen now? The hash itself is copied. Even if you change the value of the element of%person1, the element of%person2 does not change.
</p>
<p>
  <b> It is Perl's language specification that a copy is made when a hash is assigned. </b>
</p>
<h4> The default behavior for Perl assignments is all copy </h4>
<p>
  The default behavior for Perl assignments is all copy.
</p>
<p>
  This means that you can copy the basic data structure using only the language specification features, without using the <b> copy function. </b>
</p>
<p>
  Copying values ​​is a very common feature. Perl is a language specification that allows you to copy values.
</p>
<p>
  Perl's default
</p>
<p>
  First, keep in mind that Perl makes a clear distinction between values ​​and references.
</p>
<p>
  The <b> value is a copy of the value itself, and in the reference, the address is copied. </b>
</p>
<h3> Perl has a data structure called a reference </h3>
<p>
  Perl can make references just like pointers in C. For reference, it is better to have the image of an arrow.
</p>
<pre>
# Numerical reference
my $num = 1;
my $num_ref = \ $num;

# String reference
my $name ='kimoto';
my $name_ref = \ $name;

# Array reference
my @nums = (1, 2, 3);
my $nums_ref = \ @nums;

# Hash reference
my%person = (age =&gt; 1, name =&gt;'kimoto');
my $person_ref = \%person;
</pre>
<p>
  A reference is actually an address value, and it's just a number, so variables start with a "$", just like storing a number.
</p>
<table>
  <tr> <td> Numbers and strings </td> <td> $num, $name </td> <td> References to numbers and strings </td> <td> $num_ref, $name_ref </td > </tr>
  <tr> <td> Array </td> <td> @nums </td> <td> Array Reference </td> <td> $nums_ref </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> hash </td> <td>%person </td> <td> hash reference </td> <td> $person_ref </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
  The reference holds the address of the data, so if you copy the reference, it only copies the address value, not the value itself.
</p>
<pre>
# Array reference
my @nums1 = (1, 2, 3);
my $nums_ref1 = \ @nums;

my $nums_ref2 = $nums_ref1;
</pre>
<p>
  If you change the element of @nums1, the array pointed to by $nums_ref2 is the same array, so it looks like it has changed.
</p>
<h3> Syntack sugar for making array references and hash references directly </h3>
<p>
  To read the Perl source code, keep in mind that there is a syntax sugar to make array references and hash references directly.
</p>
<pre>

# Array reference
my @nums = (1, 2, 3);
my $nums_ref = \ @nums;

# The above can be written as follows
my $nums_ref = [1, 2, 3];

# Hash reference
my%person = (age =&gt; 1, name =&gt;'kimoto');
my $person_ref = \%person;

# The above can be written as follows
my $perlson_ref = {age =&gt; 1, name =&gt;'kimoto'};
</pre>
<h3> The advantage of language is that you can distinguish between values ​​and references </h3>
<p>
  Perl is misunderstood because Perl's clear distinction between values ​​and references has been criticized simply as confusing.
</p>
<p>
  It's been done to overstate the bad things about Perl, but the distinction between values ​​and references has a clear advantage.
</p>
<h4> Strings are copied by default, so it's safe </h4>
<p>
  The fact that the string is copied with the default behavior means that it will not be rewritten at the destination passed by the function.
</p>
<p>
  Since the string is copied, it does not happen that the string is rewritten and causes unintended behavior deep inside the function.
</p>
<p>
  You will realize this gratitude as your project grows.
</p>
<h4> Perl strings can be rewritten </h4>
<p>
  Perl strings can be rewritten by default.
</p>
<p>
  When a replacement is performed with a regular expression, etc., a new character string is not created, but if sufficient capacity is secured, that character string can be used.
</p>
<p>
  This is a huge benefit to string processing performance. Perl is also designed with the language itself to optimize string processing performance.
</p>
<h4> No need to write copy function </h4>
<p>
  Copying strings is a very common feature, but you don't have to write a copy function like strcopy in your program.
</p>
<p>
  You may need to copy the array from time to time, but you can copy it without writing a function with the language specification function.
</p>
<p>
  This means that Perl programs can be written very short and smart.
</p>
<h4> Understand the basics of software </h4>
<p>
  In the world below C, for example, in assembler and machine language, the data in memory is composed of one dimension.
</p>
<p>
  This is made to look as if it were multidimensional, using the concept of address reference.
</p>
<p>
  Understanding the concept of references is essential to understanding the low levels of software.
</p>
<p>
  Perl is a programming language that distinguishes between values ​​and references, not just a language that has references only.
</p>
<p>
  Beginning with Perl, which is easy to write, you can learn the basic concept of software called references.
